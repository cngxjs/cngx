# Localisation migration

<aside class="cc-tldr">

The next release makes every CNGX string follow a live language Signal. The dedicated i18n tokens become Signal tokens and the copy keys of the config tokens accept a Signal. This page lists every change your code may need, grouped by library.

</aside>

Each bullet names the symbol that changed, what it looked like before, and what to write instead. A bullet under "Breaking changes" fails to compile or changes a public type; a bullet under "Behaviour changes" compiles unchanged but renders or announces differently. With static (non-Signal) overrides, every string renders exactly as before unless a bullet says otherwise.

## Breaking changes

### @cngx/common/stepper

- `CNGX_STEPPER_I18N` is now `InjectionToken<Signal<CngxStepperI18n>>`, and `injectStepperI18n()` returns `Signal<CngxStepperI18n>`. Call the Signal where you read a label, inside a `computed()`, a template or a handler: `inject(CNGX_STEPPER_I18N).stepperLabel` becomes `inject(CNGX_STEPPER_I18N)().stepperLabel`.
- A direct `{ provide: CNGX_STEPPER_I18N, useValue: bundle }` must supply a Signal. Prefer `provideStepperI18n(withStepperI18nLabels(overrides))`, which merges over the English defaults. `withStepperI18nLabels` now also accepts a `Signal<CngxStepperI18nOverrides>` for runtime switching.
- `CngxStepperI18nFeature` maps `Signal<CngxStepperI18n>` to `Signal<CngxStepperI18n>`. A hand-written feature returns a derived Signal: `(bundle) => computed(() => ({ ...bundle(), stepperLabel: 'Schritte' }))`.
- The `i18n` option of `createStepperAnnouncementBuilders`, `createStepperSlotContextBuilders`, `createStepperAccname` and `createStepperGroupSummary` is now a `Signal`. Pass `injectStepperI18n()` as is.

### @cngx/ui/mat-stepper

- The optional third argument of `createMatStepHandle` (and so of `CngxMatStepHandleFactory` overrides) is now `Signal<CngxStepperI18n>`. An override that delegates to `createMatStepHandle` forwards the Signal unchanged; the last-resort `Step <id>` label then follows a language switch.
